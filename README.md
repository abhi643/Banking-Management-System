Banking Management System
A Java-based banking application using JDBC for database interactions. This project showcases proficiency in core Java, advanced JDBC features, and MySQL database management.
Key Features:

Account creation and management
Secure transactions (debit, credit, transfers)
Balance inquiries
Transaction handling with prepared statements

Technical Highlights:

Implemented using Java, JDBC, and MySQL
Utilizes prepared statements for enhanced security
Incorporates transaction management for data integrity
Modular design with separate classes for Users, Accounts, and AccountManager

This project demonstrates strong object-oriented programming principles and database management skills, providing a foundation for more complex financial systems.

I have attached four screenshots of the database schemas.
First you would have to create a database called "banking_system" in your MySQL CLI then using that database you woudl have to create two tables. And attributes of those two tables 
have already been described in the attached screenshots of this repository. After successfully creating these tables and changing the admin username and password in the source code, 
you may finally be able to successfully run the following jave code for Banking-Management-System if you have JDBC Connective JAR file installed in your referenc libraries of your text editor.
